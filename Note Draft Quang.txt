1. Univariate
2. Visualisation (univariate and bivariate)
 + histogram
 + box plot
 + corelation matrix
3. Data Preparation
 + make dummy
 + cleaning and joining
4 . Data Modelling
 + Prepare train and test set
 + general evaluation by accuracy and ROC Curve
 + pick up three best models ( LM,LDA and Gaussian)
5. Develop model
 + general visualisation
 + reduce logistic model by checking parameter siginificance (using chi square test)
 + reduce model by checking outliers
6. Conclusion
